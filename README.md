Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification
Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification is a Streamlit app that integrates MobileNetV2 and a CIFAR-10 model for image classification.


Users can upload images and receive predictions with confidence scores from either model.

It features a sleek navigation bar for easy switching and real-time results, which is ideal for learning and practical use.

Key Features
Dual Model Support:

MobileNetV2 (ImageNet): Recognizes 1,000 different classes from the ImageNet dataset, including everyday objects, animals, and vehicles.


Custom CIFAR-10 Model: Specializes in classifying images into one of ten specific categories such as airplanes, automobiles, and birds.
Intuitive Interface:



Navigation Bar: Seamlessly switch between MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using a sleek sidebar menu.


Real-Time Classification: Upload an image to receive immediate predictions with confidence scores.


Educational and Practical Use:

Ideal for learning about deep learning models and their performance.
Useful for practical applications where image classification is needed.
